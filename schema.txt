AstraDB Collection Schema
=========================

Database: genai_project_db
Collection: faq_vector_collection

Each document in the collection represents an FAQ item with the following structure:

{
  "question": "How do I reset my password?",
  "answer": "Click on 'Forgot Password' at login.",
  "$vector": [ OpenAI-generated vector embedding of the combined Q+A text ]
}

Explanation:
------------
- "question" (string): The user's question from the dataset.
- "answer" (string): The support response or solution.
- "$vector" (array of floats): The vectorized representation created by the embedding model (text-embedding-3-small).

The vector is automatically stored when the OpenAI Embeddings node runs during data ingestion via Langflow.

Vector search is performed on this embedded content using AstraDB's similarity search.

Indexing:
---------
- Vector Index: Enabled on "$vector"
- No manual schema definition was required due to AstraDBâ€™s schemaless structure.
