# 🚀 GenAI-Powered Data Pipeline with Langflow & AstraDB

This project implements a cloud-based GenAI pipeline using **Langflow** and **AstraDB** to create a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that answers user queries based on a dataset of FAQs.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Ingest unstructured text data (FAQ CSV file)
- Vectorize the data using OpenAI embeddings
- Store and manage vector data in AstraDB
- Build a RAG workflow using Langflow
- Enable natural language queries and contextual responses
- Deploy and test on the Datastax AI PaaS platform

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- 🔁 **Langflow** – No-code visual framework for LLM workflows  
- 🧠 **OpenAI** – Used for both embeddings and language generation  
- 🧲 **AstraDB** – Vector-enabled cloud-native database  
- 📝 **CSV** – Dataset format  
- 🐍 (Optional) Python – For alternative ingestion method
